# Gamedev stuff for PureBasic
This repository contains the code I'm writing while experimenting with OpenGL and game development using Purebasic.<br>
<br>
At the moment the repo contains:<br>

### SGL
SGL is a module built on top of GLFW.<br>
You can find the module under the directory "./sgl", and the bindings to the GLFW library under "./sgl/glfw".<br>
The bindings can be used by themselves if you are only interested in using [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) in your programs.<br> 
Description [here](https://github.com/spettroscopio/gamedev/blob/main/sgl/README.md).<br>

Plus various supporting code under the "./inc" directory shared among the main modules.<br>
