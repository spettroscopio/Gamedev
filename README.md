# Gamedev stuff for PureBasic
This repository contains the stuff I'm writing while experimenting with OpenGL and game development using Purebasic.<br>
<br>
At the moment the repo contains:<br>

### SGL
SGL is a module built on top of GLFW (https://www.glfw.org/)<br>
You can find the module under the directory "./sgl", and the bindings to the GLFW library under "./sgl/glfw".<br>
The bindings can be used by themselves if you are interested in only those.<br> 
Description [here](https://github.com/spettroscopio/gamedev/blob/main/sgl/README.md).<br>

### AUDIO
AUDIO is a module built on top of OpenAL Soft (https://openal-soft.org/) and LibSndFile (http://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/)<br>
You can find the module under the directory "./audio", the binding to the OpenAl Soft library under "./audio/openal-soft" and the binding to the LibSndFile under "./audio/libsndfile".<br> 
The bindings can be used by themselves if you are interested in only those.<br> 
Description [here](https://github.com/spettroscopio/gamedev/blob/main/audio/README.md).<br>
<br>
Plus various supporting code under the "inc" directory wich is shared by the main modules.<br>
