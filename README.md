# Gamedev stuff for PureBasic
This repository contains the stuff I write while experimenting with OpenGL and game development using Purebasic, maybe something will be useful to someone else so here it is.<br>
<br>
At the moment it contains:<br>

### SGL
SGL is a module built on top of GLFW, and it is intended to take care of all the recurring tasks required when writing OpenGL code in PureBasic.<br>
You can find the module under the folder "sgl", and the import of the GLFW library under "sgl/glfw".<br>
The import can be used by itself if you are just interested in that.<br>
More info [here](https://github.com/spettroscopio/gamedev/blob/main/sgl/README.md).


### AUDIO
AUDIO is a module built on top of OpenAL Soft and LibSndFile, and as the name suggests it offers an alternative way to play sounds in PureBasic.<br> 
You can find the module under the folder "audio", the import of the OpenAl Soft library under "audio/openal-soft" and the import of the LibSndFile under "audio/libsndfile".<br> 
The imports can be used by themselves if you are just interested in those.<br>
